**Druid Challenge 1**

![Silent Assassins](/realm/img/picks/SilentAssistanceChallenges.png "Silent Assistance") **Silent Assistance**

The ancient druids request evidence that you are a servant of balance before your inclusion to their ranks.

**Requirements**: 4 Reincarnations, Halls of Balance spell upgrade, Elf 1 and Demon 1 challenges completed

**Challenge**: Make the building targeted by Grand Balance surpass 99.9% of your production.

**Effect**: Animal Companions (1,2) works faster

**New Formula**: floor((sqrt(1 + 16 * x) - 1) / 2), where x is your Playtime (This Game) stat in hours.

**Upgrade**: Good for Druid

**Tips**:

Make sure your least-producing building still makes up a large proportion of your production (2% and up). This will necessarily balance the production of each of your other buildings around 9.09% (= 1/11). Upgrade buildings only as required to balance them. Building more Farms, Inns and Blacksmiths will increase the multiplier of the final cast of Grand Balance.

**Effect**: All spell durations increased by 1% for every 1,500 max mana.
