<p><b>About The Game</b>    
<p>Realm Grinder was first published on May 19, 2015. Since, there has been many expansions and updates. The game is constantly evolving.</p>
<p>Realm Grinder puts you in the role of a good or evil monarch, managing buildings, upgrades, and politics in order to create a large, powerful, and - most importantly - rich Realm.</a>
<p>The game belongs to the idle/incremental genre, meaning you will have to click (at least in the beginning), buy buildings and upgrades, cast spells and make other strategic choices with the ultimate goal of gaining more and more coins. There is no fixed end to the game, as you can always sell all your properties by abdicating to gain Gems, which will in turn help you generate even more coins. Abdications are one kind of soft reset, when you become even richer, you will be able to start a new life by Reincarnating, an other kind of soft reset that allows you to gain other bonuses that will further speed up your next life as monarch.
<p>Realm Grinder is the first of its kind to introduce a significant level of re-playability by giving the player choices that will changes their play-style. You will be given goals and to reach these goals, the choice to join different factions of mythic creatures. Ranging from good Fairies, evil goblins to neutral Titans, each faction have their own resource (Faction Coins obtained randomly by clicking the background). Each focuses on different mechanics, ranging from improving low tier buildings to massive spell-casting capabilities. As you play and learn, it will be yours to find out how to best reach these different goals.</p>
