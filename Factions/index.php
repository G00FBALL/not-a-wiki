<p><b>Historical Background</b></p>
<p>Good Factions are oriented to a more active game-play, focusing on spells and treasure clicks.</p>
<p>Evil Factions are oriented to a more idle game-play, focusing on steady and passive building production.</p>
<p>The Neutral Factions were added in the Ancient Races expansion, they cover a mixture both active and passive game-play and may offer faster advancement than Good and Evil factions. Neutral Factions are only available once you have reached billion gems and fulfilled certain requirements.</p>
<p>Part of the Underworld expansion, Prestige Factions are purchased in "addition to" a Vanilla faction of the same alignment. They enable the player to combine the power from both the Vanilla and Prestige factions.</p>
<p>Mercenaries were added in the After-life expansion as an ultimate powerhouse.</p>
<p>Elite Factions were added in v3.4, they are paired with the additional alignment unlocked in Ascension 2 and will be able to stack upon a base and prestige factions, for a total of three affiliations simultaneously.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Faction Spell & Upgrades</b></p>
<p>Each Faction has its own Faction specific spell and 3x3 Tier upgrades (3x4 for Mercenaries). The Tier upgrades only show up in order, so when you buy Tier 1 then Tier 2 will show up and then Tier 3, and hence cannot be bought before.</p>
<p>Each Faction also has its own symbol and color code.</p>
<p>In the first column are the Tier 1 upgrades, in the second, Tier 2 and third, Tier 3 upgrades. </p>
<p>The first colored upgrade of each tier cost Faction coins and they unlock the 3 following upgrades.</p>
<p>These upgrades are exclusive faction upgrades and cost usual coins.</p>
<p>Early game, it is advised to quickly affiliate with each Faction at least once, because for each Faction, purchasing 12 faction upgrades (this includes faction treaty) once grants their Faction Champion trophy, which in turn rewards their exclusive and universal <a href="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Heritages"><b>Heritage upgrade</b></a>.</p>
<p>Also, the quantity of bought faction upgrades is tracked throughout reincarnations and it is required to unlock Bloodline upgrades.</p>
<p>PS: In order to simplify notation, instead of using the individual names of each Faction upgrade, we generally identify them numerically. e.g.: DD5 = Druid(2,3) means: In the 2nd Tier, the third secondary Tier upgrade, belonging to Druid. (which is an upgrade named Shapeshifting), more info about the terminology can be found <a href="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Terminology/"><b>here</a></b>.</p>
