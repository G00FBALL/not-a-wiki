<p><b>Goblin Challenge 1</b></p>
<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/DiscountSeasonChallenges.png" alt="Discount Season" align="middle"> <b>Discount Season</b></p>
<p>"The goblin king has revealed the secrets to his race's success. Patience and persistence."</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: Goblin as Base Faction, Reincarnation 2+, Greed Drive upgrade purchased.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Drow can be used but not required.</p>
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Have Goblin (3,3) Green Fingers Discount roll more than 1000 seconds worth of production.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Goblin (3,3) Green Fingers Discount triggers every 2 minutes instead.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Works with Goblin</p>
<p><b>Tip 1</b>: While Green Fingers Discount says it works offline, it does not work in the same way as online, and this challenge cannot be completed offline or when coming online based on the offline effect of GFD. The challenge can be attempted in multiple tabs simultaneously, provided the save you load into the tabs does not yet have GFD purchased.</p>
<p><b>Tip 2</b>: There's a 1/6 chance of getting it every time GFD triggers.</p>
<p><b>Tip 3</b>: It can take 10 minutes or 10 minutes times however long the longest run without any values in the top sextile is for the game's RNG but an hour on average the only thing you can do to speed it up is open multiple tabs before purchasing GFD then they will have different RNG states and roll differently 6 tabs will give you a 65% chance of getting it on the first trigger, 13 will give you a 90% chance if you do it in one tab, same odds, 65% in the first 6 activations, 90% in the first 13 open multiple copies of the game all of them will overwrite the same save location, but once you get it in one tab, you can close the others and save manually also make sure you have greed drive, because that's the most common way of missing goblin 1 and if you do the tab trick, be sure you open the tabs and then purchase GFD individually in each tab, if you open multiple tabs already owning GFD, they'll all have the same RNG state.</p>
