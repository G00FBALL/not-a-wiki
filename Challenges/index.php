<p>There are several Tier challenges for each Faction. The Tiers appear as you advance, and hence can only be completed in order. You can accomplish multiple Tiers on the same run, you just cannot get later Tiers before earlier Tiers.</p>
<p><b>Vanilla Faction challenges</b>: Tier 1 upgrades boost the faction it belongs to. Tier 2 upgrades boosts another Faction. Last Tier upgrades are universal and boost basic perks.

<p>Once you have unlocked a challenge, the perks relative to the faction you are playing, being costless, will be turned on by default after the faction's spell upgrade and Challenge Power Upgrade has been purchased. </p>
