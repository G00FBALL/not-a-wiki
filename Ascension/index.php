<h6>Description</h6>
<p>Ascension is a third kind of soft reset. It was implemented to overcome the usual representation limit for coins. Most production upgrades will be shifted to a smaller range to enable the game to progress further.</p>
<p>At <b>R39</b>, <b>R99</b>, <b>R159</b> and <b>R219</b> the Reincarnation Button will say Ascension and will reset all the progress a Reincarnation would reset.</p>
<p>It will not reset your Reincarnation count, and then will revert back to the Reincarnate button for R40, R100, R160 and R220 with new requisites.</p>
<p>Each Ascension has its own main currency and ascending will replace the old one.</p>
<p>R0 - R39: Gold Coins</p>
<p>R40 - R99: Diamond Coins</p>
<p>R100 - R159: Emerald Coins</p>
<p>R160 - R219: Amethyst Coins</p>
<p>R220 - R279: Sapphire Coins</p>
<p>All upgrades that have cost coins of a previous currency (<b>not</b> Faction Coins) will be free, and the formulas for subsequent Reincarnations will change to allow continued progress.</p>
<p>All Gifts bonuses, Scry Rewards, Ruby bonuses, Event bonuses and Gem bonuses will <b>not</b> be affected by the Ascension reduction.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: It is strongly advised to get most, if not all, the trophies, challenges and artifacts possible before ascending.</p>
</br>
<h6>Income Shift</h6>
<p>Each Ascension reduces production boosts by raising the previous respective multiplier to the 1/10-th power, the so called <b>Ascension Penalty</b>, resulting in many 2-digit number bonuses in Ascension 1.<p>
<p>For instance, the 15,000% of Fairy Workers (FR2) is a x151 multiplier; 151 ^ 0.1 = 1.652, so it is now giving a 65.2% increase in Ascension 1.</p>
<p>Upgrades that increase something other than production of buildings, clicking reward or assistant production are not affected.</p>
<p><b>Ascension Penalty Formula</b>:<br>(((x / 100 + 1) ^ (0.1 ^ A) - 1) * 100)%, where x is original bonus in percentage and A the number of Ascension Penalties applied.</p>
</br>
<h6>Multiplier reduction</h6>
<p>Ascensions also reduces the Cost Multipliers for buildings and excavation.</p>
