**Factions**

There are several types of Factions:

**Vanilla**, which includes the Good & Evil factions.

**Neutral**, **Prestige** and **Mercenary**. The Vanilla Factions show up by default but the others first need to be unlocked.

Once unlocked they will stay unlocked throughout all abdications and reincarnations.

To affiliate with a Faction, you first need to choose their Alignment.

This makes all the Factions of that alignment available, and you can then choose which one to join. (Note: The icons used in the below section are the Faction's Trade Treaties, their first Faction upgrade.)

**Faction Spell & Upgrades**

---

Each Faction has its own Faction specific spell and 3x3 Tier upgrades (3x4 for Mercenaries). The Tier upgrades only show up in order , so when you buy Tier 1 then Tier 2 will show up and then Tier 3, and hence cannot be bought before.

Each Faction also has its own symbol and color code. In the example image below are the yellow Titan Faction upgrades. 

In the first column are the Tier 1 upgrades, in the second, Tier 2 and third, Tier 3 upgrades. 

The first colored upgrade of each tier, here in yellow, cost Faction coins and they unlock the 3 following black upgrades.

These black upgrades are exclusive faction upgrades and cost usual coins.

Early game, it is advised to quickly affiliate with each Faction at least once, because for each Faction, purchasing all their upgrades once grants their [Faction Champion trophy](/realm/FactionChampion), which in turn rewards their exclusive and universal Heritage upgrade.

Also, the quantity of bought faction upgrades is tracked throughout reincarnations and it is required to unlock Bloodline upgrades.

PS: In order to simplify notation, instead of using the individual names of each Faction upgrade, we generally identify them numerically. e.g.: Druid (2,3) means: In the 2nd Tier, the third secondary Tier upgrade, belonging to Druid. (which is an upgrade named Shapeshifting)
