	<p><b>In-game description</b></p>
	<p>Little is known about the Faceless, but it is said they did not possess individual minds, instead they were all connected to a central consciousness which governed all their choices and behaviours.</p>
	<p>Affiliating yourself to the Faceless Faction will boost your production based on your past choices while giving progressively better bonuses.</p>
	<p><b>Alignment</b>: Neutral</p>
	<p>The Faceless feature upgrades that becomes stronger with time. Their Heritage is based on the highest amount of buildings owned in the current reincarnation, and thus can easily be improved by doing a Goblin Bloodline run.</p>
