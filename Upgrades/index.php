            <p><b>Royal Exchanges</b>, also written <b>RE</b>s, are bought by clicking on the faction coin buttons in the upgrades tab. Each exchange initially (without any upgrades), increases the production of all buildings by 10%. They can be bought multiple times but the price increases each time.
            <p>The formula for the cost of your next exchange is: (with the above in mind, and without any upgrades.)
            <p><b>Formula</b>: floor(20\{1.1}^x), where x is the actual exchanges you have.
            <p>The cost for multiple exchanges is
            <p><b>Cost</b>: 20 FC (Base) x1.1 per additional exchange in each faction
            <p><b>Formula</b>: 20 ({1.1}^{y}-{1.1}^{x}), where x is the actual exchanges you have, and y the exchanges you are buying up to.
