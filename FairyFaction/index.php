	<p><b>In-game description</b></p>
	<p>Fairies focus on the small and common things and make them magically powerful.</p>
	<p>Affiliating yourself with the Fairy faction will hugely improve the output of lower tier buildings.</p>
	<p><b>Alignment</b>: Good</p>
	<p>Part of the Good Vanilla Factions, the Fairies can cheaply build the 3 first Tier buildings, thus boosting perks based on amount of buildings, and help get some of the building trophy series. With their spell upgrade, they can magically multiply the amount of assistants, which combined with other perks can become a very strong asset.</p>
