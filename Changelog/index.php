            <p>The new UI has been refit with that purpose in mind, but all purely web features such as tooltips and key bindings have been maintained. You may also switch from the new Upgrades view to the old one via the Switch Lists to Compact Style option in the Options menu without losing any functionalities.
            <p>Regarding development, this won’t change anything: both versions work on the same engine, so we won’t have double the work to do and there will be no risk of discontinued developing for the web platform.
            <p>Last but not least, we are already working on the next content update: Spell Upgrades! No ETA as of yet, but we’ll try our best to deliver it as soon as possible.

            <p>To all people disoriented by the new UI, here is a brief guide on how to take advantage of the new features or return to your old customs with the help of options.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.9.1</b>:
            <p>Fixed an issue with Mercenary Upgrades
            <p>BuyMAX button is no longer tutorial-locked and is available to view and change at all times.

            <p>Fixed an issue with Challenges tutorial.
            <p>Compact List View is now on by default when you open the game, option has been inverted to allow switch to the extended view.

            <p>Fixed an issue with mercenary import.

            <p>Fixed Lightning Strike spell icon not appearing on Halls of Legends under certain conditions.
            <p>Also, update about lag issues: it seems that the problems mostly happens with Chrome browser, since we don’t see as much performance drop on Firefox. We will keep investigating and working on the specific reasons why it happens.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.10.1</b>:
            <p>Added colored backgrounds for alignment-based and faction-based elements.

            <p>More changes to in-game text to make it more easily readable.
            <p>Buy All Exchanges will give priority to upgrades, so it won’t fail to buy Heritages or other upgrades that cost FC.

            <p><b>New in v1.6.55</b>
            <p>1.6.55 On June 30TH 2016 Realm Grinder will launch a major upfate which will change all the user interface and graphics.
            <p>In the new game screen you will be able to see your realm growing in the background with a unique theme for each alignment and ubique faction monuments,while the UI has been made more intuitive, easier and quicker to use and will provide more room for new elements - such as new spells - in future updates.
            <p>in this update we have also made the very early game (about the first 20-30 minutes of gameplay) easier and less boring, increasing base Faction Coins find and allowing players to purchase assistants sooner.
            <p>Last but not least, the overhaul will also introduce a whole lot of quality of life features such as the Buy All upgrades buttom, Mercenary Template Save/Load, Research Template Save/Load, in-game tutorials and hints for beginners(veterans can skip them entirely at once) and more!
            <p><b>Patch</b>: 1.6.53.0 - April 21 2016
            <p><b>NEW REINCARNATIONS POWERS</b> for Reincarnation <b>41</b> and <b>45</b>.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: more regular trophies plus two secrets, with their respective unique upgrades!
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: Heroic and Villainous Proclamations, for post-ascension only.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>:
            <p>We're still working on the new Spell System update and Neutral Prestige faction, so there are no big news to advertise here. This minor update is here to fill in the gap since they still require a bit of time before release. Regardless, we are also going forward at a good pace on the overhaul. Here are some new pics for you!
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>Patch</b>: 1.6.52.0 - April 9 2016

            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>::
            <p>As some of you may know, the next big update will feature the Neutral Prestige faction, finally bringing the intended end game to the true post-ascension stage. The Neutral Prestige will come with 9 base upgrades and a base spell as all other factions, plus a Heritage, a Bloodline and its own set of researches. Challenges will come a bit later, completing the Prestige cycle and awarding the Prestige Challenger trophy.
            <p>What you may not know yet is that before the Neutral Prestige expansion we will release at least one more minor update! This will be a huge addition to the existing spell system, allowing players to make strategic use of their excess mana regen and max mana instead of throwing everything into more Tax Collections.
            <p>Last but not least, here are some additional icon previews for the graphic overhaul!
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>

            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: SECRETS OF THE UNDERWORLD
            <p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Prestige factions: Dwarves and Drow. Starting from Reincarnation 29, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Underworld and unlock Prestige Unique Buildings and 30 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds in synergy with the faction combinations.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: new regular trophies, research-related trophies and one new secret trophy!
            <p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: new key artifacts for the Prestige Research questlines and two more.
            <p>ADDED RUBY UPGRADES RESET OPTION! You can now reset all your Ruby Upgrades and get your Rubies back to spend as you see fit, at the cost of a few Rubies.
            <p><b>Non-Expansion notes</b>:
            <p>Heaven's Domain upgrade gives a bonus of 35000% per spell active, up from 25000%.
            <p>Enchanted Fields upgrade has no longer a linear progression: it will perform better under 500 assistants, and will suffer diminishing returns after that value.
            <p>Faceless Bloodline reworked: now increases maximum mana based on mana produced in this game instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Dwarven Bloodline reworked: now increases the production of all buildings based on excavations made instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Berserking (W205) now has diminishing returns.

            <p>Gilding (A50) effect and scaling increased.
            <p>Resurrection (D175) is now based on God's Hand activity time rather than times cast. Angels' Angel Feathers and Archangel Feathers now increase mana regen by 40%, up from 20%.

            <p>Undead's Walking Dead, Plagued Buildings, Dead Fields and Undead Resilience have been improved.
            <p>Drow's Honor Among Killers now increase Faction Coin chance based on the amount of assistants you own instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Drow's Shadow Advance effect increased to 750%, up from 300%.
            <p>Elves' Elven Luck effect decreased.

            <p>Fixed an issue that caused incorrect upgrade counts.
            <p>Lightning Strike's new formula was offset for high amounts of Iron Strongholds. We changed it so that it is now slightly more powerful for very low amounts of buildings, and stabilizing to the old value when you get more.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p><b>Easter Event</b>! It will start next week :) we'll make a dedicated post for it in a few days, explaining the dates and mechanics in full detail.

            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.6.48.0</b> - Mar 6 2016
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: ASCENSIONS:
            <p>At Reincarnation 39, the Reincarnate button will turn into an Ascend button with the same requisites as Reincarnation 40. Clicking it will reset all the progress a Reincarnation would reset, but it will not reset your Reincarnation count, and then will revert back to the Reincarnate button for Reincarnation 41 with new requisites. By Ascending you will unlock a new main currency, Diamond Coins, that will be used for post-ascension upgrades and features, resulting in much smaller numbers. All upgrades that previously cost Gold Coins are now free, and the formulas for subsequent Reincarnations will change to allow continued progress. All Gifts bonuses, Scry Rewards, Ruby bonuses, Event bonuses and Gem bonuses will NOT be affected by the Ascension reduction.
            <p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: a couple artifacts were added at mid-range Reincarnation levels. They will also unlock upgrades that should help progress significantly during those stages of the game.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: two new secret trophies for your fun!
            <p>Challenges will now provide the fulfill requirement descriptions immediately. * We have decided this way since it is usually extremely difficult to figure out the requirements without a guide/forum/wiki, and since Challenges are now an important aspect of the game we don’t want players to skip them simply because they wouldn't know what to do.
            <p>Added a stat to track the activity time for each individual spell. Brainwave headstart from Faceless' Focused Thoughts Challenge is now calculated based on that stat rather than the amount of Brainwaves cast.
            <p>Autocast upgrades now also help while offline by increasing the Mana Produced and Spells cast statistics.
            <p>Offline production has been reviewed and tweaked to provide more consistent results.
            <p>Offline bonus shown in the production tooltip is now the full multiplier you get when you go offline. Previously, it was shown as 100% + multiplier.
            <p>Royal Exchanges and Excavations tooltips now show how many you have rather than the next one.
            <p>A lot of internal changes have been made to prevent tooltip inconsistencies. Several upgrades were also working incorrectly or were showing an incorrect tooltip - all of those have been fixed. All bonuses are now written as percentages rather than multipliers.
            <p><b>(Hotfix #1)</b>: Fixed minor graphic issues and Primal Balance not being affected by offline mana production.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p>As you all know, the next update in order is the Prestige Research Expansion part 1. It will include new researches for the Dwarven and Drow factions along with new upgrades, trophies and artifacts. The expansion is intended to start from Reincarnation 28 and carry players up to approximately Reincarnation 34.

            <p><b>IMPORTANT CHANGES TO TIMEWARPS AND GEM CONVERSIONS</b>: now these premium features cost Rubies rather than Kreds. This new pricing will allow players to get higher bonuses from the Ruby Production tiers, and at the same time make Timewarps and Gem Conversions much more convenient for everyone due to Ruby discounts on larger bundles.
            <p>Fixed an issue with the excavation button tooltip going outside the game window.

            <p>Collection (Economics 330) has been scaled down. It's still hugely more powerful than before due to the amount of new artifacts!
            <p>Added options to temporarily disable Premium Gifts individually, in order to allow for easier neverclick runs and trophy hunting.
            <p>Added an option to hide unavailable researches to have a tidier research panel.

            <p><b>1.5.42</b> - Dec 16 2015
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: SECRETS OF THE ANCIENTS
            <p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Neutral factions: Titans, Druids and the Faceless. Starting from Reincarnation 23, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Realm and unlock Neutral Unique Buildings and more than 40 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds more than ever before!
            <p><b>EXCAVATIONS REVAMP</b>: Excavations now have their dedicated panel, no longer littering the upgrade list with their everlasting presence and allowing players to manage them better. In the new panel, you can now Multibuy excavations in the same way you do with buildings (you can activate the Excavation Warning option in the Options menu if you don't want to excavate too much); Reset your excavation progress manually at the cost of a few Rubies; and lastly you can check Excavations stats and logs and a list of the artifacts you discovered so far.
                <b>Note</b>: Rubies are only awarded the first time you reach specific Excavation thresholds - resetting excavations and reaching them again won't award more rubies.
            <p>
                <b>RUBY REVAMP</b>: You can now get rubies for free by excavating, and they now unlock upgrades and trophies as you accumulate them. They no longer give a fixed 2% bonus, but are instead tied to a new upgrade system. As a result, their bonus per money value has been increased significantly as Rubies now not only give a nifty bonus for accumulating them, but you can also spend them to fulfill your most urgent Realm Grinding needs such as assistants, mana regeneration and more. WARNING: rubies are no longer tied to your Kongregate account and will be reset upon Hard Resetting or importing from a different save. Rubies you purchased before this expansion will be available for transfer to a save of your choice.
            <p><b>NEW AUTOCAST UPGRADE</b>: Efficient Autocasting, which will allow you to select Independent Spells (bronze icon, set with CTRL+SHIFT+Clicking the spell) to work outside of contingency settings. These spells disregard your contingency rules and are casted as soon as you have enough mana for them.
            <p><b>NEW REINCARNATION POWER</b>: At Reincarnation 25, Reincarnation Power will increase Royal Exchange bonus by 0.5% per Reincarnation.
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: new upgrade tiers for most of the already existing categories including but not limited to buildings and neutral production.

            <p>Faceless upgrades rebalanced: Deep Memory effect increased and mechanic reworked: now calculates its bonus based on the longest session (including the current one) rather than last session; Brainwave bonus increased to 2% per second (3% with Faceless Overmind), up from 1.8% (2.5%).
            <p>Quality of Life improvements: more upgrade series are now consolidate and available for Multibuy, including but not limited to Autocast Series and assistants from buildings.
            <p>New Events panel to accomodate event-based feats and quests!
            <p>Fixed lots of tooltips.

            <p>Fixed a bug that caused some neutral building trophies not to unlock correctly.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.1.14</b> - Jun 24th, 2015
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: THE ANCIENT RACES
            <p><b>NEW ALIGNMENT</b>: the neutral alignment unlocks new buildings and upgrades, as well as three new neutral factions.
            <p><b>NEW FACTIONS</b>: neutral factions are unlocked through the Archeology System, which kicks in after you get to 1 Billion Gems. From there on, follow the upgrade sseries to discover and unlock the three new prestige factions. They will cost more and perform better in the endgame than the old factions.
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: each building has 2 more upgrade tiers with higher efficiency.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: there is now a regular trophy for each of the new buildings, three new trophy tiers for all buildings, and 8 new secret trophies for you to discover.
            <p><b>Non-expansion notes</b>:
            <p>Building Upgrade prices have all been rebalanced to provide a better sense of progress.
            <p>Clicking Reward bonus from total production reduced to 1% per upgrade, down from 2%.
            <p>Hall of Legends upgrade series rebalanced. Now increase Halls of Legends production by 75-150% and all other buildings by 0.25-0.5% per trophy.
            <p>Goblins Strong Currency has been slightly toned down, Slave Trading and Hobgoblin Gladiators now give 0.75% per building up from 0.35%, Goblin Central Bank has been reworked: now it casts a free Tax Collection each time you cast a spell.
            <p>Undeads Necropolis upgrade series has been buffed to 500%, up from 300%; Corpse Supply now gives additional assistants every 15 Necropolis, down from 20; Tireless Workers now increase assistants production by 800%, up from 500%. Plagued Buildings and Epidemic Buildings now give +5% per hour, up from 2%.
            <p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000, up from 900[1]; Angelic Determination bonus has been scaled down a bit.
            <p>Evil Conquerors now gives 1.5% per Evil Fortress, up from 1%; Devil Tyrant now increases Evil Fortress production by 150%, up from 100%.
            <p>Elven Efficiency now gives 1% per Royal Exchanges, up from 0.5%; Elven Emissary now makes assistants find twice as many faction coins instead of increasing your overall chance.
            <p>The upgrade tab has been improved: there is now a button to Show/Hide purchased upgrades, and an option in the Options tab to sort them by price instead of their default order. The overall performance of the upgrade tab should have increased dramatically.
            <p>A new rollback system has been implemented to help players who don't want to lose their data. The game now creates an additional savefile every 10 minutes which is checked against your default savefile. If your default save appears to be corrupted, the game will ask you whether to load the backup save or start from scratch.
            <p><b>Shop notes</b>:
            <p>By popular demand, we added a Shop for users who wish to support the game. There you can purchase different game features with Kreds.

            <p><b>1.0.13</b> - Jun 3rd, 2015
            <p>ADDED an option for displaying numbers in scientific notation.
            <p>Offline report now addresses you with a genderless title.
            <p>Assistants now find more faction coins while offline, based on your amount of gems. This will result in a lot more faction coins.
            <p><b>Elven Heritage reworked</b>: now increases your click reward by 10% and your chance to find Faction Coins by 5%. Raises your cap to 30% (if it was lower than this).
            <p>Elven Luck now gives 10000% of your production and 100 random factions coins, up from just 1000% production.
            <p>Demonic Presence now increases Hell Portal production by 0.25% per other building, down from 0.5%.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.12</b> - Jun 1st, 2015
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: added some misc late game upgrades for your pleasure.
            <p>Moon Blessing bonus per click ratio has been reduced, but it now accounts for total clicks instead of clicks in this game. The final result should be much higher.
            <p>Elven Diplomacy no longer doubles your chance to get faction coins. Now, each time you find a faction coin, you have a 50% chance to find an additional one.
            <p>Elven Treasure casing now grants +25k per trophy instead of a flat +250k.
            <p>Added more trophies for coins gained and a secret trophy.
            <p>Mana Upgrade icons were redesigned.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.11</b> - May 31st, 2015
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused the offline report screen not to include assistants produced coins. Coins were added to your actual resource total, they just weren't added to the offline report.
            <p>More gray screen fixes.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.10</b> - May 30th, 2015
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: upon unlocking the Faction Champion trophies (buy all upgrades for a certain faction), you will unlock a Faction Heritage upgrade. This will cost 5000 Faction Coins, and will grant you a bonus depending on the faction involved. It will remain unlocked and available to purchase through soft resets. You can have all Faction Heritage upgrades at once, and they stack!
            <p><b>2 NEW SECRET TROPHIES</b>!
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.9</b> - May 28th, 2015
            <p>Added Hotkeys for Spells! 1: Tax Collection, 2: Call to Arms, 3: Alignment Spell, 4: Faction Spell.
            <p>NEW UPGRADES: each building now unlocks a new upgrade when you build 200 of them. Farms, Inns, and Blacksmiths follow the increasing rule set in a previous update, granting them a further bonus of +500%. All other buildings get a 100% bonus while Halls of Legends get the +50/+0.5xTrophy as usual.
            <p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000 mana, up from 900.[1]
            <p>Call To Arms effect has been reduced to 0.3% per building, down from 0.35%.
            <p>Added visuals for Assistants! A small, flying, faction-themed dot will be stationing beside the treasure as soon as you have at least one assistant, providing a useful tooltip when you hover it. If you wish to disable assistant graphics, there is a new checkbox in the Options tab.
            <p>Grinding Dedication now remains unlocked and available to purchase through soft resets.
            <p>Added an option to disable Trophy Popups.
            <p>Fixed an issue that could lead to a crash and grey screen.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.8</b> - May 27th, 2015
            <p>Added performance options to the Options tab: click on the switch at the top to change from Save to Options page. This will help users having performance issues, we plan to add more GUI customization options in the future like scientific notation for numbers, so look forward to them!
            <p>Fixed a bug in the demon upgrade Demonic Presence which caused Hell Portals to produce less than they were supposed to. Lazy demons were punished and are now working as intended.
            <p>Spell tooltips were not updating correctly when buying Angelic Dominance. They should now display the correct data. This has no effect on game mechanics, it was only a tooltip issue.
            <p>Hellfire Blast's bonus per trophy ratio has been increased significantly.
            <p>Night Time has been reworked. Now increases Assistant production by 50% per Necropolis you own for 20 seconds. This should make the spell much more useful in the end game at the expense of the early game.
            <p>We changed the way saves are handled. Hopefully this should help users with save issues, please let us know if it works!
            <p>Added a line in the mana bar tooltip and stats to clarify the Autocast effect.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.7</b> - May 25th, 2015
            <p>Reverted some changes to underlying libraries we did in the last update. This should solve the crash issue some players were experiencing. Sorry about the inconvenience.
            <p>Hotfixed a small issue with some upgrades not showing after a save was imported.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.6</b> - May 25th, 2015
            <p>Added thousand separator to numbers.
            <p>Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith upgrade series reworked: now upgrades are scaling from 100% to 400%. This should slightly level the difference between building tiers and give a significant boost to the Fairy faction. Fairy upgrades were toned down a bit due to this change, but the final result is still way higher than before.
            <p>Goblin's Strong Currency was still too high of a boost compared to all other factions, therefore its high-end scaling was toned down a bit more, while its starting boost is roughly the same.
            <p>Undead's Night Time spell has been buffed to have more impact on lower tier buildings.
            <p>Hall of Legends upgrade series was bugged and has been reworked. Now non-Hall of Legends buildings production should be more consistent and, in most cases, higher.
            <p>Added a warning to the manual save that will tell you if the game was unable to save your game. If that happens, follow the on-screen instructions.
            <p>This update should also help with the grey screen issue some users are having, let us know your specs if it happens again.
            <p>Change Ctrl to Command in tooltips for Mac users.
            <p>Added one more confirmation to hard reset in order to prevent accidental resets.
            <p>Fixed a typo in the 500 gems Trophy.
            <p>Fixed, reworded, and added several other tooltips for clarity. Can't get enough of these ;)
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.5</b> - May 23rd, 2015

            <p>Added tooltip info for buy10 and buy100. Hover on building and royal exchange buttons to see it.
            <p>Added tooltip info for Faction Coin chance. Hover on faction coins in lower left corner to see it.
            <p>Mana regen upgrades and the Autocast upgrade are now unlocked by mana spent instead of spells cast, and they remain unlocked through soft resets.
            <p>Mouse upgrades that provided a fixed bonus to clicking reward now remain unlocked through soft resets.
            <p>Goblin's "Strong Currency" upgrade has been significantly toned down.
            <p>Gem's ability to increase the chance of finding faction coins is now capped at 25%. Elves can still achieve 100% chance due to their faction upgrades.
            <p>Reworded several tooltips for clarity.

            <p>Improved auto-save performance.
            <p>Fixed Demonic Presence tooltip.
            <p>Fixed criteries for secret achievements not unlocking correctly.
            <p>Fixed a bug with Holy Light that caused the game to crash in rare cases.
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused Tireless Workers not to show its bonus correctly in the Stats tab. The upgrade has always worked, but the stats didn't update to reflect it properly.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.0.3</b> - May 21st, 2015

            <p>Fixed some typos and minor graphics bugs.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
