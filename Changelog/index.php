            <p><b>2.0.9.1 - 2.0.12</b>
            <p><b>Jun 30, 2016 - Graphics Notes</b>
            <p>All in-game graphics have been remade.
            <p>Added a Realm Background where you will be able to see your alignment, faction, building and assistant themes.
            <p>Removed the Treasure. Clicking is now done directly on the background.
            <p>Added particle effects for clicking on the background (can be disabled).
            <p><b>UI Notes</b>
            <p>Added a Tutorial & Hint System to help new players with the basics mechanics of the game.
            <p>Added Build Template Savers for Mercenary and Research builds.
            <p>Added a Buy 1000 option for buildings, Royal Exchanges and Excavations. Unlocked at Reincarnation 1.
            <p>Added a BUY ALL upgrades button in the Upgrades panel. Unlocked at 100 Gems.
            <p>Added Red Dot markers to highlight significant in-game situations.

            <p><b>Balance Minor Notes</b>
            <p>Faction Coin base find chance increased to 10%, up from 2%.
            <p>Formula for FC rewards from excavations reworked.
            <p>Buildings no longer give assistants when you reach 100 of them. Instead, the first two building upgrades tiers for each category now give 1 assistant each (basically you get double the assistants, and earlier). Hall of Legends does not provide assistants this way (same as before).
            <p>Spell upgrade-related secret trophies (i.e. Fairy Choir, Hell Rush…) are now normal trophies, allowing players to know their requirements beforehand.
            <p>Nonexistent Ruler cost lowered to 10e153, down from 10e183.

            <p><b>Bugfixes</b>
            <p>Fixed a bug with the requirements of Fairy Challenge 1.
            <p>Fixed countless typos and minor text issues.
            <p>In addition, we’d like to announce that Realm Grinder is going to be launched on mobile environment soon!
            <p>Once it is out, you will be able to play on all Android and iOS devices with the same Cloud account you use on Kongregate.
            <p>The new UI has been refit with that purpose in mind, but all purely web features such as tooltips and key bindings have been maintained. You may also switch from the new Upgrades view to the old one via the Switch Lists to Compact Style option in the Options menu without losing any functionalities.
            <p>Regarding development, this won’t change anything: both versions work on the same engine, so we won’t have double the work to do and there will be no risk of discontinued developing for the web platform.
            <p>Last but not least, we are already working on the next content update: Spell Upgrades! No ETA as of yet, but we’ll try our best to deliver it as soon as possible.
            <p><b>EDIT 1</b>
            <p>To all people disoriented by the new UI, here is a brief guide on how to take advantage of the new features or return to your old customs with the help of options.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.9.1</b>:
            <p>Fixed an issue with Mercenary Upgrades
            <p>BuyMAX button is no longer tutorial-locked and is available to view and change at all times.
            <p>There was an issue that could potentially caused performance lag which has now been fixed. Performance may have improved for people affected by that.

            <p>Fixed an issue with Challenges tutorial.
            <p>Compact List View is now on by default when you open the game, option has been inverted to allow switch to the extended view.
            <p>Fixed an issue with building quantity upgrades, causing some effects not working as intended (such as Dwarven Challenge 5).

            <p>Fixed an issue with mercenary import.

            <p>Fixed Lightning Strike spell icon not appearing on Halls of Legends under certain conditions.
            <p>Also, update about lag issues: it seems that the problems mostly happens with Chrome browser, since we don’t see as much performance drop on Firefox. We will keep investigating and working on the specific reasons why it happens.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.10.1</b>:
            <p>Added colored backgrounds for alignment-based and faction-based elements.
            <p>Unavailable upgrades and trophies now have a more distinguishable border and should be more easily recognizable from brighter ones.
            <p>More changes to in-game text to make it more easily readable.
            <p>Buy All Exchanges will give priority to upgrades, so it won’t fail to buy Heritages or other upgrades that cost FC.
            <p><b>Version 2.0.10.3</b>:
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused Coins Gained to be stuck at 0. Players with saves corrupted by this bug should now be able to continue playing.

            <p>Fixed research template load not spending resources.
            <p>S175 (Incantation), A25 (Delayed Reaction), E225 (Coercion) moved up 5 research points. This should solve template load issues with those researches.

            <p>1.6.55 On June 30TH 2016 Realm Grinder will launch a major upfate which will change all the user interface and graphics.
            <p>In the new game screen you will be able to see your realm growing in the background with a unique theme for each alignment and ubique faction monuments,while the UI has been made more intuitive, easier and quicker to use and will provide more room for new elements - such as new spells - in future updates.
            <p>in this update we have also made the very early game (about the first 20-30 minutes of gameplay) easier and less boring, increasing base Faction Coins find and allowing players to purchase assistants sooner.
            <p>Last but not least, the overhaul will also introduce a whole lot of quality of life features such as the Buy All upgrades buttom, Mercenary Template Save/Load, Research Template Save/Load, in-game tutorials and hints for beginners(veterans can skip them entirely at once) and more!
            <p><b>Patch</b>: 1.6.53.0 - April 21 2016
            <p><b>NEW REINCARNATIONS POWERS</b> for Reincarnation <b>41</b> and <b>45</b>.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: more regular trophies plus two secrets, with their respective unique upgrades!
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: Heroic and Villainous Proclamations, for post-ascension only.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>:
            <p>We're still working on the new Spell System update and Neutral Prestige faction, so there are no big news to advertise here. This minor update is here to fill in the gap since they still require a bit of time before release. Regardless, we are also going forward at a good pace on the overhaul. Here are some new pics for you!
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>Patch</b>: 1.6.52.0 - April 9 2016
            <p><b>PRESTIGE CHALLENGES PATCH NOTES</b>:

            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>::
            <p>As some of you may know, the next big update will feature the Neutral Prestige faction, finally bringing the intended end game to the true post-ascension stage. The Neutral Prestige will come with 9 base upgrades and a base spell as all other factions, plus a Heritage, a Bloodline and its own set of researches. Challenges will come a bit later, completing the Prestige cycle and awarding the Prestige Challenger trophy.
            <p>What you may not know yet is that before the Neutral Prestige expansion we will release at least one more minor update! This will be a huge addition to the existing spell system, allowing players to make strategic use of their excess mana regen and max mana instead of throwing everything into more Tax Collections.
            <p>Last but not least, here are some additional icon previews for the graphic overhaul!
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>

            <p><b>1.6.49</b> - Mar 18 2016
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: SECRETS OF THE UNDERWORLD
            <p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Prestige factions: Dwarves and Drow. Starting from Reincarnation 29, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Underworld and unlock Prestige Unique Buildings and 30 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds in synergy with the faction combinations.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: new regular trophies, research-related trophies and one new secret trophy!
            <p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: new key artifacts for the Prestige Research questlines and two more.
            <p>ADDED RUBY UPGRADES RESET OPTION! You can now reset all your Ruby Upgrades and get your Rubies back to spend as you see fit, at the cost of a few Rubies.
            <p><b>Non-Expansion notes</b>:
            <p>Heaven's Domain upgrade gives a bonus of 35000% per spell active, up from 25000%.
            <p>Enchanted Fields upgrade has no longer a linear progression: it will perform better under 500 assistants, and will suffer diminishing returns after that value.
            <p>Faceless Bloodline reworked: now increases maximum mana based on mana produced in this game instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Dwarven Bloodline reworked: now increases the production of all buildings based on excavations made instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Berserking (W205) now has diminishing returns.
            <p>Cursing (D25) effect increased and scaling decreased.
            <p>Refraction (A55) effect increased and scaling decreased.

            <p>Gilding (A50) effect and scaling increased.
            <p>Resurrection (D175) is now based on God's Hand activity time rather than times cast. Angels' Angel Feathers and Archangel Feathers now increase mana regen by 40%, up from 20%.
            <p>Angels' Seraphim Feathers was renamed to Wings of Liberty and reworked: now increase the production of all buildings based on mana regeneration.
            <p>Undead's Walking Dead, Plagued Buildings, Dead Fields and Undead Resilience have been improved.
            <p>Drow's Honor Among Killers now increase Faction Coin chance based on the amount of assistants you own instead of its previous effect.
            <p>Drow's Shadow Advance effect increased to 750%, up from 300%.

            <p>Fixed an issue that caused incorrect upgrade counts.
            <p>Lightning Strike's new formula was offset for high amounts of Iron Strongholds. We changed it so that it is now slightly more powerful for very low amounts of buildings, and stabilizing to the old value when you get more.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p><b>Easter Event</b>! It will start next week :) we'll make a dedicated post for it in a few days, explaining the dates and mechanics in full detail.

            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.6.48.0</b> - Mar 6 2016
            <p><b>EXPANSION</b>: ASCENSIONS:
            <p>At Reincarnation 39, the Reincarnate button will turn into an Ascend button with the same requisites as Reincarnation 40. Clicking it will reset all the progress a Reincarnation would reset, but it will not reset your Reincarnation count, and then will revert back to the Reincarnate button for Reincarnation 41 with new requisites. By Ascending you will unlock a new main currency, Diamond Coins, that will be used for post-ascension upgrades and features, resulting in much smaller numbers. All upgrades that previously cost Gold Coins are now free, and the formulas for subsequent Reincarnations will change to allow continued progress. All Gifts bonuses, Scry Rewards, Ruby bonuses, Event bonuses and Gem bonuses will NOT be affected by the Ascension reduction.
            <p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: a couple artifacts were added at mid-range Reincarnation levels. They will also unlock upgrades that should help progress significantly during those stages of the game.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: two new secret trophies for your fun!
            <p>Challenges will now provide the fulfill requirement descriptions immediately. * We have decided this way since it is usually extremely difficult to figure out the requirements without a guide/forum/wiki, and since Challenges are now an important aspect of the game we don’t want players to skip them simply because they wouldn't know what to do.
            <p>Added a stat to track the activity time for each individual spell. Brainwave headstart from Faceless' Focused Thoughts Challenge is now calculated based on that stat rather than the amount of Brainwaves cast.
            <p>Autocast upgrades now also help while offline by increasing the Mana Produced and Spells cast statistics.
            <p>Offline production has been reviewed and tweaked to provide more consistent results.
            <p>Offline bonus shown in the production tooltip is now the full multiplier you get when you go offline. Previously, it was shown as 100% + multiplier.
            <p>Royal Exchanges and Excavations tooltips now show how many you have rather than the next one.
            <p>A lot of internal changes have been made to prevent tooltip inconsistencies. Several upgrades were also working incorrectly or were showing an incorrect tooltip - all of those have been fixed. All bonuses are now written as percentages rather than multipliers.
            <p><b>(Hotfix #1)</b>: Fixed minor graphic issues and Primal Balance not being affected by offline mana production.
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>
            <p>As you all know, the next update in order is the Prestige Research Expansion part 1. It will include new researches for the Dwarven and Drow factions along with new upgrades, trophies and artifacts. The expansion is intended to start from Reincarnation 28 and carry players up to approximately Reincarnation 34.

            <p><b>IMPORTANT CHANGES TO TIMEWARPS AND GEM CONVERSIONS</b>: now these premium features cost Rubies rather than Kreds. This new pricing will allow players to get higher bonuses from the Ruby Production tiers, and at the same time make Timewarps and Gem Conversions much more convenient for everyone due to Ruby discounts on larger bundles.
            <p>Fixed an issue with the excavation button tooltip going outside the game window.
            <p><b>Hotfix #1)</b>: Added a note on the mana bar that tells the requirement for the next tier of heart production.

            <p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Neutral factions: Titans, Druids and the Faceless. Starting from Reincarnation 23, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Realm and unlock Neutral Unique Buildings and more than 40 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds more than ever before!
            <p><b>EXCAVATIONS REVAMP</b>: Excavations now have their dedicated panel, no longer littering the upgrade list with their everlasting presence and allowing players to manage them better. In the new panel, you can now Multibuy excavations in the same way you do with buildings (you can activate the Excavation Warning option in the Options menu if you don't want to excavate too much); Reset your excavation progress manually at the cost of a few Rubies; and lastly you can check Excavations stats and logs and a list of the artifacts you discovered so far.
                <b>Note</b>: Rubies are only awarded the first time you reach specific Excavation thresholds - resetting excavations and reaching them again won't award more rubies.
            <p>
                <b>RUBY REVAMP</b>: You can now get rubies for free by excavating, and they now unlock upgrades and trophies as you accumulate them. They no longer give a fixed 2% bonus, but are instead tied to a new upgrade system. As a result, their bonus per money value has been increased significantly as Rubies now not only give a nifty bonus for accumulating them, but you can also spend them to fulfill your most urgent Realm Grinding needs such as assistants, mana regeneration and more. WARNING: rubies are no longer tied to your Kongregate account and will be reset upon Hard Resetting or importing from a different save. Rubies you purchased before this expansion will be available for transfer to a save of your choice.
            <p><b>NEW AUTOCAST UPGRADE</b>: Efficient Autocasting, which will allow you to select Independent Spells (bronze icon, set with CTRL+SHIFT+Clicking the spell) to work outside of contingency settings. These spells disregard your contingency rules and are casted as soon as you have enough mana for them.

            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: new upgrade tiers for most of the already existing categories including but not limited to buildings and neutral production.

            <p>ADDED TWO MORE AUTOCASTING UPGRADES:
            <p>Priority Autocasting allows you to prioritize casting of certain spells. Spells with a lower priority will not fire unless higher priority ones are already active.
            <p>Contingency Autocasting allows you to set a minimum amount of mana before firing spells, then it checks for priorities. If you have an instant cast spell in the queue, it will be cast until you deplete your mana, at which point the contingency ends.

            <p>Tooltips now refresh themselves every second.

            <p>Added an additional tier for building upgrades.
            <p>The building upgrade series for Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith has been rebalanced: now scales up to +500%, then decreases down to 100%. The final result is still higher than the current value, and much higher than other buildings.
            <p>Grand Balance hotfix reverted and mechanics reworked: now the target building changes dynamically as you improve buildings production.
            <p>Excavation base coin cost has been increased to 500Sp, up from 50Sp. Faction Coins found by Excavation have been scaled down slightly (the chance is still the same).

            <p>Added an option to temporarily disable Rubies and Gift of the Heroes bonuses for players who missed some trophies or just want to experiment with different bonuses.
            <p>Added a warning for players who don't get offline gains due to incorrect clock settings.
            <p>Grand Balance has been changed to work only on the amount of buildings you have at the moment of casting. This was necessary to counter an exploit which caused the coin output to go far beyond the intended usage of the druid spell under certain circumstances.
            <p>Elven Treasure Casing now gives +250,000 coins per trophy, up form 25,000; Sylvan Treasure Frills and Secret Click Techniques now give 10% of total production, up from 5%.

            <p>Territorial Expanse was recently nerfed incorrectly due to a typo in the formula, which was always greater than 1%, even with thousands of Labyrinths. This was unintended, therefore the nerf was reverted and the formula was fixed. Territorial Expanse chance should now have a significantly greater diminishing return for higher amounts of Labyrinths (more than ~450) while having a significantly higher chance below that value.
            <p>We fixed an issue with Grand Balance which caused the spell to miscalculate the building it should have empowered. Now it should always empower the building types which contributes less to your total income.
            <p><b>------------------------------</b>
            <p><b>1.1.16</b> - Jun 26th, 2015

            <p>Territorial Expanse chance has been scaled down.
            <p>Fixed an issue that caused clicks not to be registered correctly in the upgrades tab.
            <p>Added an option to disable the Show/Hide button in the Upgrades tab. Shown/Hidden upgrades will stay the way you left them when you disabled the button.
            <p>Hovering the Timewarp buttons now shows an [sic] handy tooltip which tells you approximately how many coins and factions coins you will gain by purchasing it.
            <p>Shop window has been made bigger, letting you see all available items at once.
            <p>Gem Conversion buttons both in the Options and Shop tabs will gray out if you would gain 0 gems.

            <p>Faceless Heritage has been scaled down slightly.
            <p>Fixed an issue which caused some players not to receive offline production under certain circumstances.
            <p>Fixed a bug that caused some neutral building trophies not to unlock correctly.

            <p><b>NEW FACTIONS</b>: neutral factions are unlocked through the Archeology System, which kicks in after you get to 1 Billion Gems. From there on, follow the upgrade sseries to discover and unlock the three new prestige factions. They will cost more and perform better in the endgame than the old factions.
            <p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: each building has 2 more upgrade tiers with higher efficiency.
            <p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: there is now a regular trophy for each of the new buildings, three new trophy tiers for all buildings, and 8 new secret trophies for you to discover.
            <p><b>Non-expansion notes</b>:
            <p>Building Upgrade prices have all been rebalanced to provide a better sense of progress.
            <p>Clicking Reward bonus from total production reduced to 1% per upgrade, down from 2%.

            <p>Goblins Strong Currency has been slightly toned down, Slave Trading and Hobgoblin Gladiators now give 0.75% per building up from 0.35%, Goblin Central Bank has been reworked: now it casts a free Tax Collection each time you cast a spell.
            <p>Undeads Necropolis upgrade series has been buffed to 500%, up from 300%; Corpse Supply now gives additional assistants every 15 Necropolis, down from 20; Tireless Workers now increase assistants production by 800%, up from 500%. Plagued Buildings and Epidemic Buildings now give +5% per hour, up from 2%.
            <p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000, up from 900[1]; Angelic Determination bonus has been scaled down a bit.

            <p>Elven Efficiency now gives 1% per Royal Exchanges, up from 0.5%; Elven Emissary now makes assistants find twice as many faction coins instead of increasing your overall chance.
            <p>The upgrade tab has been improved: there is now a button to Show/Hide purchased upgrades, and an option in the Options tab to sort them by price instead of their default order. The overall performance of the upgrade tab should have increased dramatically.
            <p>A new rollback system has been implemented to help players who don't want to lose their data. The game now creates an additional savefile every 10 minutes which is checked against your default savefile. If your default save appears to be corrupted, the game will ask you whether to load the backup save or start from scratch.
            <p><b>Shop notes</b>:
            <p>By popular demand, we added a Shop for users who wish to support the game. There you can purchase different game features with Kreds.

            <p>NEW UPGRADES: each building now unlocks a new upgrade when you build 200 of them. Farms, Inns, and Blacksmiths follow the increasing rule set in a previous update, granting them a further bonus of +500%. All other buildings get a 100% bonus while Halls of Legends get the +50/+0.5xTrophy as usual.
            <p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000 mana, up from 900.[1]
            <p>Call To Arms effect has been reduced to 0.3% per building, down from 0.35%.

            <p>Hellfire Blast's bonus per trophy ratio has been increased significantly.
            <p>Night Time has been reworked. Now increases Assistant production by 50% per Necropolis you own for 20 seconds. This should make the spell much more useful in the end game at the expense of the early game.

            <p>Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith upgrade series reworked: now upgrades are scaling from 100% to 400%. This should slightly level the difference between building tiers and give a significant boost to the Fairy faction. Fairy upgrades were toned down a bit due to this change, but the final result is still way higher than before.
            <p>Goblin's Strong Currency was still too high of a boost compared to all other factions, therefore its high-end scaling was toned down a bit more, while its starting boost is roughly the same.
            <p>Undead's Night Time spell has been buffed to have more impact on lower tier buildings.
            <p>Hall of Legends upgrade series was bugged and has been reworked. Now non-Hall of Legends buildings production should be more consistent and, in most cases, higher.
            <p>Added a warning to the manual save that will tell you if the game was unable to save your game. If that happens, follow the on-screen instructions.
            <p>This update should also help with the grey screen issue some users are having, let us know your specs if it happens again.
            <p>Change Ctrl to Command in tooltips for Mac users.

            <p>Goblin's "Strong Currency" upgrade has been significantly toned down.
