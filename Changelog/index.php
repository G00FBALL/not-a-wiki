				<p><b>Jun 30, 2016 - Graphics Notes</b></p>
				<p>All in-game graphics have been remade.</p>
				<p>Added a Realm Background where you will be able to see your alignment, faction, building and assistant themes.</p>
				<p>Removed the Treasure. Clicking is now done directly on the background.</p>
				<p>Added particle effects for clicking on the background (can be disabled).</p>
				<p><b>UI Notes</b></p>
				<p>Added a Tutorial & Hint System to help new players with the basics mechanics of the game.</p>
				<p>Added Build Template Savers for Mercenary and Research builds.</p>
				<p>Added a Buy 1000 option for buildings, Royal Exchanges and Excavations. Unlocked at Reincarnation 1.</p>
				<p>Added a BUY ALL upgrades button in the Upgrades panel. Unlocked at 100 Gems.</p>
				<p>Added Red Dot markers to highlight significant in-game situations.</p>

				<p><b>Balance Minor Notes</b></p>
				<p>Faction Coin base find chance increased to 10%, up from 2%.</p>
				<p>Formula for FC rewards from excavations reworked.</p>
				<p>Buildings no longer give assistants when you reach 100 of them. Instead, the first two building upgrades tiers for each category now give 1 assistant each (basically you get double the assistants, and earlier). Hall of Legends does not provide assistants this way (same as before).</p>
				<p>Spell upgrade-related secret trophies (i.e. Fairy Choir, Hell Rush…) are now normal trophies, allowing players to know their requirements beforehand.</p>
				<p>Nonexistent Ruler cost lowered to 10e153, down from 10e183.</p>
				<p>Titan Challenge 2, Harmony of Thought now only increases Faceless playtime for Hive Mind purposes, rather than in all circumstances.</p>
				<p><b>Bugfixes</b></p>
				<p>Fixed a bug with the requirements of Fairy Challenge 1.</p>
				<p>Fixed countless typos and minor text issues.</p>
				<p>In addition, we’d like to announce that Realm Grinder is going to be launched on mobile environment soon!</p>
				<p>Once it is out, you will be able to play on all Android and iOS devices with the same Cloud account you use on Kongregate.</p>
				<p>The new UI has been refit with that purpose in mind, but all purely web features such as tooltips and key bindings have been maintained. You may also switch from the new Upgrades view to the old one via the Switch Lists to Compact Style option in the Options menu without losing any functionalities.</p>
				<p>Regarding development, this won’t change anything: both versions work on the same engine, so we won’t have double the work to do and there will be no risk of discontinued developing for the web platform.</p>
				<p>Last but not least, we are already working on the next content update: Spell Upgrades! No ETA as of yet, but we’ll try our best to deliver it as soon as possible.</p>
				<p><b>EDIT 1</b></p>
				<p>To all people disoriented by the new UI, here is a brief guide on how to take advantage of the new features or return to your old customs with the help of options.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.9.1</b>:</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with Mercenary Upgrades</p>
				<p>BuyMAX button is no longer tutorial-locked and is available to view and change at all times.</p>
				<p>There was an issue that could potentially caused performance lag which has now been fixed. Performance may have improved for people affected by that.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.9.2</b>:</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with Challenges tutorial.</p>
				<p>Compact List View is now on by default when you open the game, option has been inverted to allow switch to the extended view.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with building quantity upgrades, causing some effects not working as intended (such as Dwarven Challenge 5).</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.9.3</b>:</p>
				<p>Scrollbars are now draggable.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with mercenary import.</p>
				<p>Fixed other minor issues.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.10</b>:</p>
				<p>Added an option to disable menu sliding animations: enabling this will make them open instantly.</p>
				<p>Added an option to let the BuyAll button also buy Royal Exchanges.</p>
				<p>Added a notification when using the BuyAll button letting you know how many upgrades/exchanges were purchased.</p>
				<p>Added a separate BuyMax button for exchanges.</p>
				<p>Background is no longer scrollable.</p>
				<p>Increased Mana Globe text size.</p>
				<p>Fixed already purchased upgrades being still purchasable.</p>
				<p>Fixed the BuyMax tutorial when having the button disabled in the options.</p>
				<p>Fixed the spell list being invisible under certain conditions.</p>
				<p>Fixed Lightning Strike spell icon not appearing on Halls of Legends under certain conditions.</p>
				<p>Also, update about lag issues: it seems that the problems mostly happens with Chrome browser, since we don’t see as much performance drop on Firefox. We will keep investigating and working on the specific reasons why it happens.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.10.1</b>:</p>
				<p>Added colored backgrounds for alignment-based and faction-based elements.</p>
				<p>Unavailable upgrades and trophies now have a more distinguishable border and should be more easily recognizable from brighter ones.</p>
				<p>More changes to in-game text to make it more easily readable.</p>
				<p>Buy All Exchanges will give priority to upgrades, so it won’t fail to buy Heritages or other upgrades that cost FC.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.10.3</b>:</p>
				<p>Fixed a bug that caused Coins Gained to be stuck at 0. Players with saves corrupted by this bug should now be able to continue playing.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue related to collapsing research categories which caused warfare researches not to be visible.</p>
				<p>Fixed research template load not spending resources.</p>
				<p>S175 (Incantation), A25 (Delayed Reaction), E225 (Coercion) moved up 5 research points. This should solve template load issues with those researches.</p>
				<p>Added Mana and Spells stats to the Stat page.</p>
				<p>Changelog and Template list scrollbars are now draggable.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.10.4</b>:</p>
				<p>Follow-up workaround for the NaN gems (short numbers will show it as 1 M) bug which should allow players to continue playing again. We’ll keep investigating this issue closely until we solve it permanently.</p>
				<p>Background assistants will now increase in amount as you get more assistants, and they will now be mixed between base and prestige faction (if you have one).</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.10.5 and .6</b>:</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue causing unintended advancing of in-game time.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.11</b>:</p>
				<p>All panels have been increased in size to allow a broader view of the items inside.</p>
				<p>Research panel reworked completely for compact mode. The new view should be more organized and easy to understand and use.</p>

				<p>Added an assistant indicator to the bottom bar.</p>
				<p>Increased text size for some UI elements.</p>
				<p>Added hover effect on compact list upgrades.</p>

				<p><b>Version 2.0.11.1</b>:</p>
				<p>Fixed a crash occurring in version 2.0.11.</p>
				<p><b>Version 2.0.12</b>:</p>
				<p>The loading screen has been revamped.</p>
				<p>Text has been made more readable throughout the game, especially red text on several backgrounds.</p>
				<p>Mercenary upgrades are no longer purchasable multiple times.</p>
				<p>Research upgrades are no longer purchasable multiple times.</p>
				<p>Improved Mana Globe performance.</p>

				</p>
				<p>1.6.55 On June 30TH 2016 Realm Grinder will launch a major update which will change all the user interface and graphics.</p>
				<p>In the new game screen you will be able to see your realm growing in the background with a unique theme for each alignment and ubique faction monuments,while the UI has been made more intuitive, easier and quicker to use and will provide more room for new elements - such as new spells - in future updates.</p>
				<p>in this update we have also made the very early game (about the first 20-30 minutes of gameplay) easier and less boring, increasing base Faction Coins find and allowing players to purchase assistants sooner.</p>
				<p>Last but not least, the overhaul will also introduce a whole lot of quality of life features such as the Buy All upgrades button, Mercenary Template Save/Load, Research Template Save/Load, in-game tutorials and hints for beginners(veterans can skip them entirely at once) and more!</p>

				<p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b>:
					<p>We're still working on the new Spell System update and Neutral Prestige faction, so there are no big news to advertise here. This minor update is here to fill in the gap since they still require a bit of time before release. Regardless, we are also going forward at a good pace on the overhaul.

The Neutral Prestige will come with 9 base upgrades and a base spell as all other factions, plus a Heritage, a Bloodline and its own set of researches. Challenges will come a bit later, completing the Prestige cycle and awarding the Prestige Challenger trophy.</p>
				<p>What you may not know yet is that before the Neutral Prestige expansion we will release at least one more minor update! This will be a huge addition to the existing spell system, allowing players to make strategic use of their excess mana regen and max mana instead of throwing everything into more Tax Collections.</p>

			<div class="autohide">
				<p><b>1.6.48.0</b> - Mar 6 2016</p>
				<p><b>EXPANSION</b>: ASCENSIONS:</p>
				<p>At Reincarnation 39, the Reincarnate button will turn into an Ascend button with the same requisites as Reincarnation 40. Clicking it will reset all the progress a Reincarnation would reset, but it will not reset your Reincarnation count, and then will revert back to the Reincarnate button for Reincarnation 41 with new requisites. By Ascending you will unlock a new main currency, Diamond Coins, that will be used for post-ascension upgrades and features, resulting in much smaller numbers. All upgrades that previously cost Gold Coins are now free, and the formulas for subsequent Reincarnations will change to allow continued progress. All Gifts bonuses, Scry Rewards, Ruby bonuses, Event bonuses and Gem bonuses will NOT be affected by the Ascension reduction.</p>
				<p><b>NEW ARTIFACTS</b>: a couple artifacts were added at mid-range Reincarnation levels. They will also unlock upgrades that should help progress significantly during those stages of the game.</p>
				<p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: two new secret trophies for your fun!</p>
				<p>Challenges will now provide the fulfill requirement descriptions immediately. * We have decided this way since it is usually extremely difficult to figure out the requirements without a guide/forum/wiki, and since Challenges are now an important aspect of the game we don’t want players to skip them simply because they wouldn't know what to do.</p>
				<p>Added a stat to track the activity time for each individual spell. Brainwave headstart from Faceless' Focused Thoughts Challenge is now calculated based on that stat rather than the amount of Brainwaves cast.</p>
				<p>Autocast upgrades now also help while offline by increasing the Mana Produced and Spells cast statistics.</p>
				<p>Offline production has been reviewed and tweaked to provide more consistent results.</p>
				<p>Offline bonus shown in the production tooltip is now the full multiplier you get when you go offline. Previously, it was shown as 100% + multiplier.</p>
				<p>Royal Exchanges and Excavations tooltips now show how many you have rather than the next one.</p>
				<p>A lot of internal changes have been made to prevent tooltip inconsistencies. Several upgrades were also working incorrectly or were showing an incorrect tooltip - all of those have been fixed. All bonuses are now written as percentages rather than multipliers.</p>
				<p><b>(Hotfix #1)</b>: Fixed minor graphic issues and Primal Balance not being affected by offline mana production.</p>
				<p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b></p>
				<p>As you all know, the next update in order is the Prestige Research Expansion part 1. It will include new researches for the Dwarven and Drow factions along with new upgrades, trophies and artifacts. The expansion is intended to start from Reincarnation 28 and carry players up to approximately Reincarnation 34.</p>

The event will last 4 days and will feature different mechanics from the previous event, involving a new spell, a new resource and new upgrades.

				<p><b>1.5.42</b> - Dec 16 2015</p>
				<p><b>EXPANSION</b>: SECRETS OF THE ANCIENTS</p>
				<p><b>NEW RESEARCHES</b>: The Research system has been expanded to the Neutral factions: Titans, Druids and the Faceless. Starting from Reincarnation 23, excavate enough and follow the questline to discover the Secrets of the Realm and unlock Neutral Unique Buildings and more than 40 new researches for you to explore, unlock and customize your builds more than ever before!</p>
				<p><b>EXCAVATIONS REVAMP</b>: Excavations now have their dedicated panel, no longer littering the upgrade list with their everlasting presence and allowing players to manage them better. In the new panel, you can now Multibuy excavations in the same way you do with buildings (you can activate the Excavation Warning option in the Options menu if you don't want to excavate too much); Reset your excavation progress manually at the cost of a few Rubies; and lastly you can check Excavations stats and logs and a list of the artifacts you discovered so far.</p>
				<p><b>Note</b>: Rubies are only awarded the first time you reach specific Excavation thresholds - resetting excavations and reaching them again won't award more rubies.</p>
				<p><b>RUBY REVAMP</b>: You can now get rubies for free by excavating, and they now unlock upgrades and trophies as you accumulate them. They no longer give a fixed 2% bonus, but are instead tied to a new upgrade system. As a result, their bonus per money value has been increased significantly as Rubies now not only give a nifty bonus for accumulating them, but you can also spend them to fulfill your most urgent Realm Grinding needs such as assistants, mana regeneration and more. WARNING: rubies are no longer tied to your Kongregate account and will be reset upon Hard Resetting or importing from a different save. Rubies you purchased before this expansion will be available for transfer to a save of your choice.</p>
				<p><b>NEW AUTOCAST UPGRADE</b>: Efficient Autocasting, which will allow you to select Independent Spells (bronze icon, set with CTRL+SHIFT+Clicking the spell) to work outside of contingency settings. These spells disregard your contingency rules and are casted as soon as you have enough mana for them.</p>
				<p><b>NEW REINCARNATION POWER</b>: At Reincarnation 25, Reincarnation Power will increase Royal Exchange bonus by 0.5% per Reincarnation.</p>
				<p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: new upgrade tiers for most of the already existing categories including but not limited to buildings and neutral production.</p>
				<p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: new trophy tiers for most of the already existing categories, and several secret trophies for you to discover :)</p>

				<p>Quality of Life improvements: more upgrade series are now consolidate and available for Multibuy, including but not limited to Autocast Series and assistants from buildings.</p>
				<p>New Events panel to accommodate event-based feats and quests!</p>
				<p>Fixed lots of tooltips.</p>
				<p><b>Technical notes</b>:</p>
				<p>Game performance improved.</p>
				<p>With this expansion, we changed they way Cloud accounts are handled. If you did not Link your previous Cloud account to Kongregate, a new one will be automatically created and linked to Kongregate for you. If you have any question, or if you can no longer access your old Cloud account, please contact us via PM.</p>

				<p><b>NEW PROGRESS SYSTEM</b>: RESEARCH! When you purchase the Unique Building for your faction, you will unlock Research Facilities for your Vanilla factions.

			<div class="autohide">
				<p><b>1.1.22</b> - Jul 7th, 2015</p>
				<p>ADDED TWO MORE AUTOCASTING UPGRADES:</p>
				<p>Priority Autocasting allows you to prioritize casting of certain spells. Spells with a lower priority will not fire unless higher priority ones are already active.</p>
				<p>Contingency Autocasting allows you to set a minimum amount of mana before firing spells, then it checks for priorities. If you have an instant cast spell in the queue, it will be cast until you deplete your mana, at which point the contingency ends.</p>
				<p>Added an additional tier for building upgrades.</p>
				<p>Tooltips now refresh themselves every second.</p>
				<p>Moved Options to a button in the lower left corner of the game window, next to the Coins panel. Renamed Options tab to Save tab.</p>
				<p>Added game version in the Save tab. Clicking it will open a changelog.</p>
				<p>Next Gem Tooltip revamped: now shows how many coins are required for the next unit in the same order of magnitude. (e.g. 11.3T gems will show how many coins you need for 12T gems).</p>
				<p>Many Druid upgrades were rebalanced: Druidic Vocabulary, Bardic Knowledge, Mabinogion bonus were scalred down; Building Forest and Building Jungle now give 0.75% bonus, down from 1%; Earthly Bond and Earthly soul now give +0.75 mana per Stone Pillars, down from +1; Shapeshifting now produce 0.15 m/s per assistant, down from 0.2.</p>
				<p>Call to Arms now suffers from slight diminishing return.</p>
				<p>Reworded several tooltips and descriptions.</p>
				<p><b>(Hotfix #1)</b>: Reworded Call to Arms description to reflect the new diminishing return.</p>
				<p><b>(Hotfix #2)</b>: Fixed an issue which caused unintended incorrect clock errors.</p>
				<p><b>(Hotfix #3)</b>: Fixed an issue that caused the slide bar from Contingency Autocasting to appear even if you didn't purchase the actual upgrade.</p>

			<div class="autohide">
				<p><b>1.1.19</b> - Jul 1st, 2015</p>
				<p><b>SECRET TROPHIES UNLEASHED</b>: now each secret trophy unlocked also unlocks an unique upgrade. They will be visible after you get the trophy and have gained enough coins to be in range of their cost in the current session.</p>
				<p>Added an additional tier for building upgrades.</p>
				<p>The building upgrade series for Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith has been rebalanced: now scales up to +500%, then decreases down to 100%. The final result is still higher than the current value, and much higher than other buildings.</p>
				<p>Grand Balance hotfix reverted and mechanics reworked: now the target building changes dynamically as you improve buildings production.</p>
				<p>Excavation base coin cost has been increased to 500Sp, up from 50Sp. Faction Coins found by Excavation have been scaled down slightly (the chance is still the same).</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue that caused faction coins received from Elven Luck not to be added in the total faction coins stat.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issues that caused mana produced by Magical Treasure no to be added in the total mana produced stat.</p>
				<p>Fixed a typo due to Very Bad Guys upgrade which caused the Halls of Legends description to show an incorrect value.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with Plagued Buildings and Epidemic Buildings which caused them not to work properly while offline.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue with the excavation warning option that caused it to show a message even when you couldn't actually buy the upgrade.</p>
				<p>Reworded several tooltips for clarity.</p>
				<p><b>------------------------------</b></p>
				<p><b>1.1.18</b> - Jun 29th, 2015</p>
				<p>Added an option to display warnings when purchasing Excavation or Exchanges that use coins from your faction.</p>
				<p>Added an option to temporarily disable Rubies and Gift of the Heroes bonuses for players who missed some trophies or just want to experiment with different bonuses.</p>
				<p>Added a warning for players who don't get offline gains due to incorrect clock settings.</p>
				<p>Grand Balance has been changed to work only on the amount of buildings you have at the moment of casting. This was necessary to counter an exploit which caused the coin output to go far beyond the intended usage of the druid spell under certain circumstances.</p>
				<p>Elven Treasure Casing now gives +250,000 coins per trophy, up form 25,000; Sylvan Treasure Frills and Secret Click Techniques now give 10% of total production, up from 5%.</p>
				<p>Fixed a small inconsistency with the random distribution of Faction Coins which caused Fairy and Demon coins to have a slightly lesser chance to be found than other faction coins.</p>
				<p><b>------------------------------</b></p>
				<p><b>1.1.17</b> - Jun 27th, 2015</p>
				<p>Territorial Expanse was recently nerfed incorrectly due to a typo in the formula, which was always greater than 1%, even with thousands of Labyrinths. This was unintended, therefore the nerf was reverted and the formula was fixed. Territorial Expanse chance should now have a significantly greater diminishing return for higher amounts of Labyrinths (more than ~450) while having a significantly higher chance below that value.</p>
				<p>We fixed an issue with Grand Balance which caused the spell to miscalculate the building it should have empowered. Now it should always empower the building types which contributes less to your total income.</p>
				<p><b>------------------------------</b></p>
				<p><b>1.1.16</b> - Jun 26th, 2015</p>
				<p>Fixed a typo in Grand Balance tooltip which showed the production boost as a percentage while it's actually a flat multiplier (game-play was unchanged).</p>
				<p>Territorial Expanse chance has been scaled down.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue that caused clicks not to be registered correctly in the upgrades tab.</p>
				<p>Added an option to disable the Show/Hide button in the Upgrades tab. Shown/Hidden upgrades will stay the way you left them when you disabled the button.</p>
				<p>Hovering the Timewarp buttons now shows an [sic] handy tooltip which tells you approximately how many coins and factions coins you will gain by purchasing it.</p>
				<p>Shop window has been made bigger, letting you see all available items at once.</p>
				<p>Gem Conversion buttons both in the Options and Shop tabs will gray out if you would gain 0 gems.</p>
				<p><b>------------------------------</b></p>
				<p><b>1.1.15</b> - Jun 24th, 2015</p>
				<p>Titan's Lightning Strike was giving far more faction coins than intended. This has been corrected. The production boost has also been scaled down to 4x Iron Strongholds and its cost has been raised to 900 mana.</p>
				<p>Faceless Heritage has been scaled down slightly.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue which caused some players not to receive offline production under certain circumstances.</p>
				<p>Fixed a bug that caused some neutral building trophies not to unlock correctly.</p>

				<p><b>EXPANSION</b>: THE ANCIENT RACES</p>
				<p><b>NEW ALIGNMENT</b>: the neutral alignment unlocks new buildings and upgrades, as well as three new neutral factions.</p>
				<p><b>NEW FACTIONS</b>: neutral factions are unlocked through the Archeology System, which kicks in after you get to 1 Billion Gems. From there on, follow the upgrade sseries to discover and unlock the three new prestige factions. They will cost more and perform better in the endgame than the old factions.</p>
				<p><b>NEW UPGRADES</b>: each building has 2 more upgrade tiers with higher efficiency.</p>
				<p><b>NEW TROPHIES</b>: there is now a regular trophy for each of the new buildings, three new trophy tiers for all buildings, and 8 new secret trophies for you to discover.</p>
				<p><b>Non-expansion notes</b>:</p>
				<p>Building Upgrade prices have all been rebalanced to provide a better sense of progress.</p>
				<p>Clicking Reward bonus from total production reduced to 1% per upgrade, down from 2%.</p>
				<p>Hall of Legends upgrade series rebalanced. Now increase Halls of Legends production by 75-150% and all other buildings by 0.25-0.5% per trophy.</p>
				<p>Goblins Strong Currency has been slightly toned down, Slave Trading and Hobgoblin Gladiators now give 0.75% per building up from 0.35%, Goblin Central Bank has been reworked: now it casts a free Tax Collection each time you cast a spell.</p>

Plagued Buildings and Epidemic Buildings now give +5% per hour, up from 2%.</p>
				<p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000, up from 900[1]; Angelic Determination bonus has been scaled down a bit.</p>
				<p>Evil Conquerors now gives 1.5% per Evil Fortress, up from 1%; Devil Tyrant now increases Evil Fortress production by 150%, up from 100%.</p>
				<p>Elven Efficiency now gives 1% per Royal Exchanges, up from 0.5%; Elven Emissary now makes assistants find twice as many faction coins instead of increasing your overall chance.</p>
				<p>The upgrade tab has been improved: there is now a button to Show/Hide purchased upgrades, and an option in the Options tab to sort them by price instead of their default order. The overall performance of the upgrade tab should have increased dramatically.</p>
				<p>A new rollback system has been implemented to help players who don't want to lose their data. The game now creates an additional savefile every 10 minutes which is checked against your default savefile. If your default save appears to be corrupted, the game will ask you whether to load the backup save or start from scratch.</p>
				<p><b>Shop notes</b>:</p>
				<p>By popular demand, we added a Shop for users who wish to support the game. There you can purchase different game features with Kreds.</p>

				<p>Moon Blessing bonus per click ratio has been reduced, but it now accounts for total clicks instead of clicks in this game. The final result should be much higher.</p>
				<p>Elven Diplomacy no longer doubles your chance to get faction coins. Now, each time you find a faction coin, you have a 50% chance to find an additional one.</p>

You can have all Faction Heritage upgrades at once, and they stack!</p>
				<p><b>2 NEW SECRET TROPHIES</b>!</p>

				<p><b>1.0.9</b> - May 28th, 2015</p>
				<p>Added Hotkeys for Spells! 1: Tax Collection, 2: Call to Arms, 3: Alignment Spell, 4: Faction Spell.</p>
				<p>NEW UPGRADES: each building now unlocks a new upgrade when you build 200 of them. Farms, Inns, and Blacksmiths follow the increasing rule set in a previous update, granting them a further bonus of +500%. All other buildings get a 100% bonus while Halls of Legends get the +50/+0.5xTrophy as usual.</p>
				<p>God's Hand base cost has been increased to 1000 mana, up from 900.[1]</p>
				<p>Call To Arms effect has been reduced to 0.3% per building, down from 0.35%.</p>
				<p>Added visuals for Assistants! A small, flying, faction-themed dot will be stationing beside the treasure as soon as you have at least one assistant, providing a useful tooltip when you hover it. If you wish to disable assistant graphics, there is a new checkbox in the Options tab.</p>

				<p>Added an option to disable Trophy Popups.</p>
				<p>Fixed an issue that could lead to a crash and grey screen.</p>

				<p><b>1.0.8</b> - May 27th, 2015</p>
				<p>Added performance options to the Options tab: click on the switch at the top to change from Save to Options page. This will help users having performance issues, we plan to add more GUI customization options in the future like scientific notation for numbers, so look forward to them!</p>
				<p>Fixed a bug in the demon upgrade Demonic Presence which caused Hell Portals to produce less than they were supposed to. Lazy demons were punished and are now working as intended.</p>
				<p>Spell tooltips were not updating correctly when buying Angelic Dominance. They should now display the correct data. This has no effect on game mechanics, it was only a tooltip issue.</p>
				<p>Hellfire Blast's bonus per trophy ratio has been increased significantly.</p>
				<p>Night Time has been reworked. Now increases Assistant production by 50% per Necropolis you own for 20 seconds. This should make the spell much more useful in the end game at the expense of the early game.</p>
				<p>We changed the way saves are handled. Hopefully this should help users with save issues, please let us know if it works!</p>

				<p>Added thousand separator to numbers.</p>
				<p>Farm, Inn, and Blacksmith upgrade series reworked: now upgrades are scaling from 100% to 400%. This should slightly level the difference between building tiers and give a significant boost to the Fairy faction. Fairy upgrades were toned down a bit due to this change, but the final result is still way higher than before.</p>
				<p>Goblin's Strong Currency was still too high of a boost compared to all other factions, therefore its high-end scaling was toned down a bit more, while its starting boost is roughly the same.</p>
				<p>Undead's Night Time spell has been buffed to have more impact on lower tier buildings.</p>
				<p>Hall of Legends upgrade series was bugged and has been reworked. Now non-Hall of Legends buildings production should be more consistent and, in most cases, higher.</p>
				<p>Added a warning to the manual save that will tell you if the game was unable to save your game. If that happens, follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
