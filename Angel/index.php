	<p>"The archangel leaders have entrusted you with a sacred mission:quickly harness enough magical power to become a beacon of magical selflessness. Extorting from the poor is forbidden."</p>
	<p><b>Requirements</b>: Angel as Base Faction, Reincarnation 8+, Angel Bloodline, Angel challenge 1 completed.</p>
	<p><b>Note</b>: Dwarven can be used but not required.</p>
	<p><b>Challenge</b>: Generate 500,000 Mana in less than 3 hours without casting a single Tax Collection.</p>
	<p><b>Effect</b>: Multiplicatively increases Maximum Mana by 30%.</p>
	<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Works with Undead</p>
	<p><b>Tip 1</b>: Avoid getting Angelic Wisdom (2,2) and Angelic Dominance (3,2) because they reduce your Mana-spent-per-second ability.</p>
	<p><b>Tip 2</b>: Autocast God's Hand with bar at 0. Add in CtA if excess Mana builds up. When Mana Regeneration gets too high, just put every spell on Gold autocast (Not Tax Collection of course).</p>
