**In-game description**

The mighty and fearless Demons cannot bother with petty trifles, they only care for greatness and power.

Their Bloodline, more used in late games, can become powerful for long reincarnations as it increases production based on total time spent being Evil.

**Effect**: Increases the production of Evil Fortresses and Hell Portals.

**Formula**: 200 * x ^ 0.8, where x is your Trophies Unlocked stat.
