        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Ascension 4 (R220+)</p>
		<p>This set of upgrade appears with no other unlock requirement.</p>
		<p>With each Legacy Container you can choose a Legacy (equal to the set of 3 faction upgrades of the same tier) that doesn't match your current faction.</p>
		<p>This unlocks those 3 faction upgrades for purchase for their normal coin cost (see faction upgrade costs at <a href="/realm/Ascension4" research="Ascension 4"><b>Ascension 4</b></a>).</p>
		<p>You can purchase more Legacies for a progressively increasing cost.</p>
		<p>The current limit is 4 Legacy Container - not including the special one granted by the Research Relativity (F11750).</p>
		<p><b>Note</b>: While the Container from Relativity is free to purchase, the granted upgrades still have their normal coin cost. It also does not influence the cost of the other container.</p>
		<p><b>Base Faction Legacies</b>:</p>
		<p><b>Coin Cost</b>: (1e72 * (1,000 ^ (x ^ 2 - x))), where x is your current Legacy container.</p>
		<p><b>Faction Coin Cost</b>: (1e33 * (1,000 ^ ( 0.5 * ( x ^ 2 - x)))), where x is your current Legacy container.</p>
		<p><b>Prestige Faction Legacies</b>:</p>
		<p><b>Coin Cost</b>: (1e135 * (1,000 ^ (x ^ 2 - x))), where x is your current Legacy container.</p>
		<p><b>Faction Coin Cost</b>: (1e45 * (1,000 ^ ( 0.5 * ( x ^ 2 - x)))), where x is your current Legacy container.</p>
